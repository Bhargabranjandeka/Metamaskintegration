# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

An alternative way to approach integration with Metamask is by using Web3.js libraries. Using custom hooks and inject connector we can get address of the wallet account. 

Pros - easy integration with Metamask with the use of hooks and injector.
cons - Compatibilty issues with browser and node.js modules. 
Issues - event emitter object , buffer , String objects in JS.
Requires active debugging on these compatibilty issues.
